# Nix image for Bitbucket Pipelines

> https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21567

For some weird reason, Bitbucket Pipelines runs various commands using absolute paths
in its setup script which results in errors like these:

```shell
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/mkfifo: No such file or directory
/bin/sh: /bin/echo: No such file or directory
```

Needless to say that doesn't work with Nix.

This image works around the problem by symlinking the necessary binaries to the paths Bitbucket uses.

In addition, it also installs `git` as it's usually required for all kinds of stuff (eg. Flakes).

Last, but not least Flakes are enabled by default.


## Usage

```yaml
pipelines:
  branches:
    master:
      - step:
        image: ghcr.io/auvred/nix-bitbucket
        name: Tests
        script:
          - nix-channel --update
          - nix develop -c YOUR_TEST_COMMAND
```

**Pro tip:** Use a [tagged version](https://github.com/users/sagikazarmark/packages/container/nix-bitbucket/versions) instead of `latest`.
